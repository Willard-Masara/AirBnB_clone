Project Description:
This is a clone of the Airbb application. We will tackle the prjct in stanzas, the first part is about how to set up the console fot the app, and file storage. The rest of tiot will have various other issues looking into thehings like the RESTful API and so forth

DEscription of the command interpreter:
The interpreter that we have built isa calle d console.py, it shows on the terminal as hbnb executable. It is a shell environment where commadns that pertain to the  attributes we have built are called and those that are not part of them are simply not recognised. 
As an example one may type ?  and theconsole will interpret this as the command for help
